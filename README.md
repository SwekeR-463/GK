# GK - General Kernels for Model Training and Inference

This repository contains a collection of general kernels commonly used in model training and inference tasks. These kernels are implemented in **Triton** and are designed to be modular and reusable across different machine learning projects.

##  Contents

- **Softmax**: Efficient softmax implementation for probability distribution.
- **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)**: Implementation of RoPE for positional encoding.

##  Future Work
- [ ] Training GPT using these Kernels
- [ ] add torch.autograd.function to the kernels to make them trainable
- [ ] Adding Tilelang Kernels
